Despite being one of the most-demanding skills, the students tend to skip learning Data Structures and Algorithms as they consider it just a mere subject of Computer Science
discipline. However, what they don't know is the utmost usage of Data Structures in developing efficient applications and real life. Undoubtedly, when it comes to the placement
scenario, it is witnessed that Data Structure and Algorithm is one of the prominent parts of the recruitment process in the on-campus and off-campus placement process.
Top tier tech brands such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Youtube, etc. focus more on designing things in the most-optimal manner that improves user experience and enhances
tracking and managing. For example, an optimal solution for a problem with time complexity of O(nLogn) instead of O(n^2) can help an organization with n users save thousands 
of dollars and time and resources. Hence, these companies ask most of the questions related to Data Structures and Algorithms in interviews to assess a candidate's approach for
solving any real-world problem.
    <br> So, the objective of this project is to provide a platform for users to study the basics and concepts of Data Structure and Algorithms. This is a web-based project  where 
we provide simple explanation and step by step algorithms on every topic and simple example of code in C++ language. There is also a small quiz taken at the end of every topic to
check whether the concepts are clear or not. This will help users not just to learn but practice the algorithms and check themselves all at one place. They won’t need to scroll
various websites for explanation, example with code and MCQ questions on Data Structures and Algorithms.
